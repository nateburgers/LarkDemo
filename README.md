Lark Demo (was "Snark Demo")
=========

Demo of Prototyping langauge Lark

Please excuse the title change and lack of documentation. The name of Lark was originally Snark, and due to the rush of MHacks
I did not have the time to rename everything in the repository.

#How to run the demo
Startup a TCP server from terminal on port 13370
To do so, open up a terminal window and type [nc 13370]

Then open the .xcodeproj and build and run the app in the simulator.
